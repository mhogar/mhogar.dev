    "This year I participated in the GMTK game jam. This was the first jam I have ever been a part of and the first time I had really ever attempted to make a complete game. Considering I had only 48 hours, this was pretty ambitious for a first attempt, but I think the result was more than I could have hoped for.",
    "The process was a real rollercoaster, from points of extreme satisfaction to moments of frustration. When something worked, it felt great. When it didn't, not so much. An example of both comes from the teleporter animation and the movement mechanic. The former was surprisingly easy to pull off. Godot has great animation tools and using them to pull off this simple, yet very charming, animation felt electric. The movement mechanic was a fair bit tricker. I spent most of the first night trying to develop a basic prototype because I couldn't get the position to tile position conversion quite right. Every time I failed it was frustrating because I was on a tight deadline and if I couldn't get the base mechanic to work, the rest of the game was doomed. Of course, I did eventually figure it out, and the rest of the game was in fact, not doomed.",
    "Although, another notable moment of panic occurred mere hours before the submission deadline. I had completed the game and was doing a final playtest of every level. Unfortunately, I ran into a game-breaking bug on the level I called \"Pair of Flowers\",  whereupon completion, the next two levels would load on top of each other. At first, I wasn't sure what was going on and thought I might have to cut the level, but luckily it didn't take too long to find the bug and patch it. As it turns out, a very similar bug was found later by one of the game's reviewers, but this one was less likely to be encountered by the average player. I guess the fact that the game's event system was stiched together with bubblegum was really starting to show.",
    "On a brighter note, I feel like the graphics went over well. In the beginning, I only had a very general idea of the type of game I wanted to make and had no ideas on how it should look. I was playing around in GoDot's tilemap editor and rediscovered that it has an option for isometric tilemaps. Quite a few tutorials later, I had learned how to create art in the isometric style and how to configure it to work GoDot. The sound effects were also surprisingly easy to create using the awesome tool I found. The only part I didn't do myself was the background music. Music production is a field I have no experience in and didn't have the time to attempt in 48 hours, but it is definitely something I want to learn and put to use next year.",
    "Honestly, I could go on forever about every cog and gear that makes the game work. I might make a devlog on it to explain some of the implementation details, so stay tuned for that. All in all, this was a great experience and I am really looking forward to next year."
